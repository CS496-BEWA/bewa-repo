# BEWA

The BEWA program is a website built for small to moderate sized businesses to utilize in order to more efficiently and effectively handle organizing their employees and hours. It contains a collection of useful applications for any hours-based company, with a calendar, requests made, announcements, promoting/demoting employees, and a (currently unfinished) messaging feature.
